msva-perl (0.8.1-2) testing-proposed-updates; urgency=low

  DO NOT RESTART THE MONKEYSPHERE VALIDATION AGENT WHEN UPGRADING FROM
                    BEFORE 0.8.1 TO 0.8.1 OR LATER!!

  * Older versions of the MSVA default to prompting the user to restart
    the running daemon when they detect that they've been upgraded.
    However, due to changes in the dependent libraries, these restarts are
    likely to cause the agent to crash, which in turn is likely to
    terminate the user's X11 session.
  
  * Future versions of the MSVA default to not prompt for such a restart
    when an upgrade is detected, and if they do crash this should not
    terminate the user's X11 session.
